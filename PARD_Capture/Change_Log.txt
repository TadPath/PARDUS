/* About box now shows version from the PARDCAP_VERN #define so it is */
/* always up to date.                                                 */
/* New key option 'v' which allows the user to select the video       */
/* device number and the main window now shows the current video      */
/* device being processed. These changes were made to allow Pardcap   */
/* to run along side other video devices in current use (by other     */
/* programs or by other instances of Pardcap) and not be restricted   */
/* to only using /dev/video0 .                                        */
/* I added an option to do dark field subtraction for the colour      */
/* preview (no flat field division options exists for colour preview  */
/* as yet - only for monochrome preview).                             */
/* I added options to do vertical and/or horizontal flip on the       */

/* these new optins since the last version - older settings files     */
/* will need to be manually updated to be compatible with (readable   */

/* Bug fix: Now the maximum available frame rates are shown in the    */
/* settings combo list (not the minimum as previously).               */
/* Bug fix: Control names were not always printing correctly in the   */
/* settings dialogue box after a camera was closed and re-opened.     */
/* This is now fixed.                                                 */
